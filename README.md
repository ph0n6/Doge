# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* Note:

  * FactoryGirl deprecated -> change all to FactoryBot (factory_girl -> factory_bot)
  * Because of stub() deprecated : 'helper.stub(:user_signed_in?)' -> 'allow(helper).to receive(:user_signed_in?)'
